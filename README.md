NOSTRA is a responsive and modern fashion e-commerce website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project focuses on creating a clean user interface, smooth navigation, and a realistic shopping experience similar to real-world clothing websites. It is designed to showcase front-end development skills, layout structuring, and UI consistency across multiple pages.

The website includes a Home page featuring a hero slider, brand showcase, new arrivals, most wanted products, and a limited offer section to attract users. Each product card is designed with clear visuals, pricing, sale tags, and interactive icons to enhance user engagement. The layout adapts well to different screen sizes while maintaining alignment and spacing.

The Collection page provides a structured product listing with filtering options such as Occasion (Summer, Party, Beach) and Colours (Red, Blue, White, Green). A search bar allows users to quickly find products, demonstrating practical UI functionality often found in e-commerce platforms. The grid layout ensures products are displayed neatly beside the filter section.

The Contact Us page contains a simple and user-friendly form where users can submit their name, email, and message. This section focuses on clarity, accessibility, and form styling.

A Newsletter Subscription section is included to encourage user engagement and updates, while a consistent footer across all pages provides branding and informational content.
